your config file should be of the following format:

        host = 'dbhost.cs.man.ac.uk'
        user = ''
        passwd = ''
        database = '2018_comp10120_w4'

with your own username and password in the single quotes. 

The file should be saved as 'dbconfig.py' in the same directory as the drawing
script in order for it to work. you should add your config file to your 
.gitignore so your credentials are kept hidden. 

This file ('configFormat') should not be added to the .gitignore, as it doesn't 
have sensitive data in it
